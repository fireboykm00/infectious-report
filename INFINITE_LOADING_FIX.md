# 🔧 Infinite Loading Fix

## Problem

Dashboard page loads successfully (GET 200) but shows infinite loading spinner in browser.

## Root Cause

React Query `QueryClient` was created at **module level**, causing:
- State sharing between requests
- Potential memory leaks
- Infinite refetching on window focus

## The Fix

### Changed `/src/providers.tsx`:

**Before:**
```typescript
// ❌ Created once at module level
const queryClient = new QueryClient({...});

export function Providers({ children }) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Created fresh for each component mount
export function Providers({ children }) {
  const [queryClient] = useState(
    () => new QueryClient({
      defaultOptions: {
        queries: {
          staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5,
          retry: 1,
          refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // ✅ Prevents infinite refetching
        },
      },
    })
  );
```

## What Changed

1. ✅ QueryClient created inside component using `useState`
2. ✅ Added `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` to prevent auto-refetch loops
3. ✅ Each page load gets fresh QueryClient instance

## Test It

```bash
# 1. Restart dev server
# 2. Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)
# 3. Navigate to /dashboard
# Should load and stop loading
```

## Expected Result

- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ Loading spinner disappears
- ✅ Data shows up
- ❌ No infinite loading
