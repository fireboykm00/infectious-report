## Gaps (Critical for Full MVP)

Below is a consolidated list of missing pages, API integrations, core features, and backend/integration gaps required to reach a full MVP.

### Missing Pages
- ❌ Lab Module - Lab technicians attach results to cases
- ❌ Analytics Dashboard - Maps, charts, trends, disease heatmaps
- ❌ Outbreak Management - View/manage outbreaks, assign actions
- ❌ Notifications/Feedback - View sent/received messages
- ❌ Admin Panel - Manage users, roles, facilities, disease codes

### Missing API Integration
- ❌ Case reporting not connected to Supabase (shows toast but doesn't save)
- ❌ Dashboard shows mock data instead of real Supabase queries
- ❌ Lab results API endpoints not implemented
- ❌ Analytics API not implemented
- ❌ Outbreak APIs not implemented
- ❌ File upload to S3/storage not implemented

### Missing Core Features
- ❌ Notifications: Email/SMS/Push notification system (Twilio, SendGrid, FCM)
- ❌ Real-time Updates: Supabase realtime subscriptions not connected to UI
- ❌ Geolocation: Map picker for case locations
- ❌ File Attachments: Photo/document upload with retry
- ❌ Contact Tracing: Contact tracking functionality
- ❌ Outbreak Detection: Alert threshold triggers
- ❌ Data Tables: Server-side pagination & filters
- ❌ Receipt Numbers: Confirmation codes after submission

### Backend / Integration Gaps
- ❌ Message bus/queue system (Redis/BullMQ)
- ❌ Background jobs for notifications
- ❌ Monitoring/observability (Prometheus, Grafana)
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Docker containerization

### MVP Completion Status
- 📊 Estimated completion: ~40%

### What Works Now
- ✅ User registration with role selection
- ✅ Login/logout
- ✅ Protected routing
- ✅ Database schema fully designed
- ✅ Offline storage infrastructure
- ✅ Basic UI pages and forms
- ✅ Security policies (RLS)

### What's Not Working
- ❌ No actual data persistence from forms
- ❌ Dashboard shows hardcoded mock data
- ❌ No real-time collaboration
- ❌ No notifications
- ❌ No analytics or visualization
- ❌ No lab workflow
- ❌ No outbreak management

### Recommended Next Steps for MVP Completion

**Priority 1: Connect Core Workflows**
- Wire `ReportCase` form to Supabase - Save case reports with file uploads
- Connect Dashboard to real data - Query `case_reports` table
- Implement sync service - Call sync on reconnection
- Add receipt numbers - Generate confirmation after submit

**Priority 2: Lab Module**
- Create `/lab` page for lab technicians
- Implement lab result attachment to cases
- Show status updates when results arrive

**Priority 3: Analytics**
- Create `/analytics` page with maps, charts, and filters

Notes:
- The original text ended mid-line at "Create /analytics page wi"; I completed that line as "Create `/analytics` page with maps, charts, and filters" as a reasonable assumption. If you prefer a different wording or want the original truncated content kept as-is, tell me and I will update the file.
