Nice — this is a great brief and a perfect candidate for a complete, machine-actionable implementation spec. Below I’ve turned your app idea and problem analysis into a full FEATURES + PROJECT SCOPE + IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE the AI (or engineering team) can build from directly. I **don’t** include delivery time estimates — instead I give ordered phases and clear acceptance criteria so a builder can begin immediately and know what “done” looks like.

# Infectious Disease Surveillance & Response System (IDSR) — Implementation Reference

---

## 1 — High-level goals (single-line)

Provide a secure, scalable web-based IDSR that supports reliable data collection (offline-capable), real-time reporting & alerts, analytics & visualization, coordinated response (tasking, contact tracing, logistics), feedback & public communication, and integrations (labs, national EHRs, WHO/IHR).

---

## 2 — Scope

### In-scope

* Mobile-first web UI + progressive web app (PWA) for offline data capture and sync.
* Role-based access: Community Health Worker (CHW), Facility User, Lab Tech, District Officer, National Officer, Epidemiologist, Admin.
* Standardized forms (ICD/ICD-11, custom case definitions) + configurable case definitions.
* Laboratory uploads (CSV/PDF) & automated matching/deduplication.
* Threshold and anomaly detection alerts (configurable).
* Response workflows: digital line-lists, contact tracing, task tracker (assign/complete), vaccination campaign logistics.
* Notifications: in-app, email, SMS gateway (pluggable).
* Public anonymized dashboards + internal dashboards.
* Audit/logging, data lineage, backups, role-based audit trail.
* APIs for integrations (HL7/FHIR optional), CSV exports.
* Multi-language UI (configurable).
* Security controls (RBAC, MFA, encryption at rest/in transit).
* Automated testing, CI/CD, infra as code, monitoring & observability.

### Out-of-scope (for MVP)

* Hardware sensor integrations (thermometers) — optional later.
* Full AI outbreak forecasting (provide hooks/APIs only).
* Full offline native mobile SDK (PWA offline first is in-scope).
* Legal/regulatory advice — implementor to ensure local compliance.

## 7 — API design (examples, REST + JSON)

### Authentication

* `POST /api/v1/auth/login` -> { token, refresh_token }
* `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` -> { token }

### Case endpoints

* `POST /api/v1/cases` -> create a case (accepts offline creation id)
* `GET /api/v1/cases?facility_id=&status=&date_from=&date_to=&page=` -> paginated list
* `GET /api/v1/cases/{id}` -> case details
* `PUT /api/v1/cases/{id}` -> update
* `POST /api/v1/cases/bulk_import` -> lab CSV import job kickoff

### Lab ingestion

* `POST /api/v1/labs/upload` -> file upload -> returns job id
* `GET /api/v1/labs/jobs/{job_id}` -> status + parsed rows
* `POST /api/v1/labs/match` -> triggers dedupe/match with mapping rules

### Alerts & thresholds

* `GET /api/v1/alerts` -> list active alerts
* `POST /api/v1/alerts/config` -> admin config thresholds

### Tasks & incident

* `POST /api/v1/incidents` -> create incident
* `POST /api/v1/tasks` -> assign task
* `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}/complete` -> mark done

### Exports

* `GET /api/v1/reports/daily?region_id=` -> CSV/JSON

---

## 8 — Key algorithms & background jobs (design)

### Deduplication (lab + case matching)

* Candidate keys: national_id, phone, patient name normalized (lowercase, strip punctuation), dob, sample id.
* Scoring: weighted match (exact national_id=100, phone=80, name+dob fuzzy ~70). Use double metaphone + Levenshtein for name fuzzy.
* Procedure:

  1. When lab file parsed, for each row build candidate keys.
  2. Query recent patients/cases within time window (e.g., 6 months).
  3. Score candidates; if > threshold -> auto-link; if borderline -> put in review queue.
  4. Log all matches to audit table.

### Anomaly detection (stateless baseline)

* For each location+case_type compute rolling 7-day moving average and standard deviation.
* If today_count > baseline + K * std (K configurable), raise threshold alert.
* Optional: EWMA for sensitivity and seasonal decomposition for weekly seasonality.

### Offline sync + conflict resolution

* Each offline object has `client_generated_id` and `last_client_timestamp`.
* On sync, server applies last-write-wins per field unless conflict marker set -> push conflict to human review queue.

---

## 9 — UI/UX — primary screens & flows

### Users & roles

* Login / Password + MFA.
* Role-specific home dashboards.

### CHW / Facility flow

* Quick case entry (minimal required fields).
* Attach photo / lab sample id.

* Approve/assign incidents and tasks.

### Epidemiologist flow

* Advanced analytics: filters, build cohorts, download line lists.
* Threshold config UI.

### Admin flow

* User management, role assignments, facility tree management, thresholds, integrations.

### Public dashboard (anonymized)

* Map + time trends; downloadable PDFs; subscription to email bulletins.

---

## 10 — Security & compliance checklist

* TLS 1.2+; HSTS.
* JWT tokens + refresh; server-side token revocation list.
* Password policy & optional SSO (SAML/OAuth).
* Field-level encryption for PII (phone, national id).
* Audit logging for all CRUD operations.
* Role-based access control with least privilege.
* Data retention & purge policies (configurable).
* Consent and opt-in for geolocation; ability to anonymize location to admin-defined radius.
* Compliance guide: map to IHR (2005) & local data protection laws (e.g., GDPR-like considerations).

---

## 11 — Testing strategy

* Unit tests for API and core logic (deduplication, thresholding).
* Integration tests for job pipelines (lab ingestion, notifications).
* E2E tests for critical flows (case creation -> lab match -> alert -> task assignment).
* Load testing for ingestion & dashboard (simulate bulk CSV lab uploads).
* Security tests: static code analysis, dependency scanning, penetration tests.
* Automated acceptance tests (per acceptance criteria in section 14).

---

## 12 — Monitoring & SRE

* Metrics: API latency, request rates, background job throughput, DB query times, sync failures.
* Alerts: high error rate, queue backlog > threshold, storage near capacity, high 5xx rate.
* Dashboards in Grafana; logs in ELK or similar.
* Disaster recovery: daily DB backups, point-in-time recovery enabled.

---

## 13 — CI/CD + deployment

* Git flow: feature branches → PRs → CI (lint, unit tests) → merge to main → CD to staging → run integration tests → promote to prod.
* Infra as code: Terraform for infra, Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.
* Blue/green or canary deployments for API service updates.
* Secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault / cloud secrets).
* Canary monitoring for new releases (error spike auto-rollback).

---

## 14 — Phased implementation & milestones (ordered, no time estimates)

**Phase 0 — Project setup**

* Repos, CI/CD, infra bootstrap, SSO/auth prototype, DB skeleton.

**Phase 1 — Core MVP**

* Users/roles, facility model, PWA case entry, basic case CRUD, list views, basic dashboards, simple threshold alerts, CSV export, audit logs.

**Phase 2 — Labs & Deduplication**

* Lab upload, parsers, matching/dedupe engine, review queue, background job pipeline.

**Phase 3 — Response Tools**

* Line-lists, contacts table, contact tracing UI, tasks & incidents, notifications (email + SMS).

**Phase 4 — Analytics & Reporting**

* Time-series charts, maps, configurable thresholds, scheduled reports, public dashboard.

**Phase 5 — Logistics & Integrations**

* Inventory/stock ledger, supply alerts, FHIR endpoints, SFTP/API integrations for national systems.

**Phase 6 — Harden & Scale**

* Advanced security (field encryption), load optimization, multi-region deployment, advanced anomaly detection/ML hook-ups.

**Phase 7 — Training, localization & roll-out**

* Local language translations, training materials, offline site deployment, monitoring ramp-up.

For every phase produce: user stories, acceptance criteria, API contracts, minimal UI mocks, test cases.

---

## 15 — Acceptance criteria examples (so the AI knows “done”)

* Case creation: a CHW can create a suspected case in offline mode; after reconnect, the record syncs with server and appears in facility dashboard with same client id preserved. (Test: create offline, toggle network, sync; server shows record and audit log.)
* Lab import: upload CSV of 1000 rows; job completes without crash; 95% auto-matched or queued for review; no duplicate cases created. (Test: import sample dataset; check dedupe audit.)
* Alerting: threshold configured for Region X and disease Y triggers within 1 minute of matching condition and creates an alert visible to district/national roles. (Test: insert synthetic cases to trigger threshold; verify alert sent & task created.)
* Task tracking: assigned task must include auditable action, status transitions logged. (Test: create → assign → complete; check audit log.)
* Security: all PII fields flagged and encrypted at rest; non-authorized role cannot access PII. (Test: role-based access test.)

---

## 16 — Operational & rollout considerations

* Pilot in 1 district → iterate on workflows (feedback loop).
* Training program: 1-day CHW training, 1-week district orientation, online docs + short videos.
* Data migration strategy: map legacy forms to new schema with mapping tool + dry-run.
* Support & maintenance: ticket system, SLA for critical incidents, scheduled backups & upgrade windows.

---

## 17 — Logging, data retention & privacy controls

* Configurable retention: raw lab files stored for X years (configurable per country).
* Privacy pipeline: anonymize before public dashboard; can aggregate into grids to obscure individuals.
* Right-to-be-forgotten workflows (if legally required) — admin can mark patient records for anonymization/purge; retain audit footprint.

---

## 18 — Integration points & adapters

* SMS providers (pluggable): Twilio, Africa’s Talking, local SMPP.
* Email: SMTP / Resend API.
* FHIR & HL7: read-only and write endpoints for key entities (Patient, Observation, DiagnosticReport).
* SFTP dropfolder for labs: watch folder ingestion.
* National ID/EHR: OAuth or API sync (mapping layer to translate fields).

---

## 19 — Observability metrics & KPIs (for program managers)

* Reporting timeliness: median time from event occurrence → report received.
* Percent of cases with lab confirmation.
* Alert detection latency (time from threshold to notification).
* Sync success rate (offline → server).
* Reporting completeness by facility (% of expected reports sent).
* Stockout events prevented (logistics effect).

---

## 20 — Risks & mitigations

* Low connectivity: mitigated via PWA offline + small payloads, retry logic, SMS fallbacks.
* Data quality (poor inputs): enforced validation, training, data quality dashboards, gamification for better reporting.
* Privacy breach: field-level encryption, strict RBAC, security audits.
* User adoption: staged pilot, local champions, simplified mobile UX.

---

## 21 — Deliverables for AI/builder (what to produce next)

* Full API OpenAPI (Swagger) spec for all endpoints.
* DB migrations and seed data for sample regions/facilities.
* Frontend component library & screens (React + Tailwind) with storybook.
* Background job worker templates and job queue architecture.
* Lab-parsing sample scripts + test CSVs.
* CI pipeline templates & helm charts.
* Acceptance test suite (automated).
* Documentation: admin guide, CHW quickstart, integration manual.
