- Gender selector
- Symptom checklist (fever, cough, rash, diarrhea, etc.)
- Disease dropdown with search
- Onset date picker
- Notes field

#### 1.2 ICD-11 Disease Codes & Case Definitions

- [ ] Add symptom checkers that auto-flag priority cases
- [ ] Create `/src/lib/diseases.ts` with disease definitions
- [ ] Implement smart disease suggestion based on symptoms

**Solution:** Each role sees appropriate scope

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement data filtering in queries (facility/district/national)
- [ ] Create `/src/hooks/useFilteredCases.ts`
- [ ] Dashboard cards show only user's scope
