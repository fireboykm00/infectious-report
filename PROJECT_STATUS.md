## ⚠️ Blockers & Issues

### Critical (Must Fix Before Testing)
1. **Missing npm package:** `@supabase/ssr`
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/ssr
   ```

2. **Database migration not applied:** `disease_codes` table
   ```bash
   # Run in Supabase dashboard or CLI
   supabase/migrations/20251029_add_disease_codes.sql
   ```

3. **Missing React Hook Form packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod date-fns
   ```

### Non-Critical (Won't block testing)
1. Storage bucket `case-attachments` needs to be created in Supabase
2. Some old page files still reference non-existent components
3. Type errors in middleware (will work once @supabase/ssr installed)
